# openMINDS_core

The openMINDS_core repository is part of the open Metadata Initiative for Neuroscience Data Structures (openMINDS). It contains the 
schema-templates used for registering neuroscience research products into the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph.

For more information on openMINDS in general and the processing pipelines for the schema-templates please go to the main repository: https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS

## v1.0 (schema-templates)
The core v1.0 schemas (originally called MINDS) were documented as JSON-schemas.

## v2.0 (schema-templates)
The core v1.0 schemas (originally called MINDS) were only documented in the Wiki.

## v3.0 (schema-templates)
The core v3.0 schemas (MINDS) are JSON-schema inspired schema-templates with a few custom template-properties (prefixed with `"_"`) which allow us to simplify their readability and increase their reusability.
